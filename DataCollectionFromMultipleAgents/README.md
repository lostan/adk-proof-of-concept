# Data Collection from Multiple Agents - Proof of Concept (PoC)

This project is a Proof of Concept designed to demonstrate and test the capabilities of the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** in managing complex multi-agent interactions, collective memory, and intent-based delegation.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this PoC is to evaluate:
1.  **Agent-to-Agent Transfer**: How seamlessly a "Root" agent can delegate specific tasks to specialized sub-agents.
2.  **Collective Memory**: The ability of the system to maintain a shared state where information provided to one agent is accessible by others, reducing redundancy and improving user experience.
3.  **Dynamic Intent Routing**: The Root agent's capacity to interpret user input and route the conversation to the appropriate sub-agent based on the data provided.

## 🤖 Agent Architecture

The system consists of a hierarchical structure with one orchestrator and two specialized workers:

### 1. Root Agent (`root_agent.yaml`)
*   **Role**: Orchestrator & Coordinator.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Initializes the conversation.
    *   Consults sub-agents to understand what data needs to be collected.
    *   Identifies user intent (e.g., if the user provides a name, it routes to Sub-Agent 1; if a phone number, to Sub-Agent 2).
    *   Consolidates the final results into a clean markdown bullet list once all data is collected.

### 2. Sub-Agent 1 (`sub_agent_1.yaml`)
*   **Specialization**: Personal Identity Data.
*   **Data Points**: Name, Height, and Age.
*   **Behavior**: Collects its specific fields and returns control to the Root agent.

### 3. Sub-Agent 2 (`sub_agent_2.yaml`)
*   **Specialization**: Contact & Demographic Data.
*   **Data Points**: Mobile number, Gender, and Nationality.
*   **Behavior**: Collects its specific fields and returns control to the Root agent.

## 💡 Key Concepts Tested

### Collective Memory
One of the core features of this PoC is the **shared memory space**. Users don't need to repeat themselves. If a piece of information is shared with the Root agent or another sub-agent, it is recorded. When a sub-agent requiring that data takes control, it retrieves the value from the collective memory and merely confirms it with the user if necessary.

### Intent-Based Routing
The Root agent acts as an intelligent router. It doesn't follow a rigid linear path; instead, it analyzes the user's natural language.
*   *User: "My name is Leonardo"* -> Root routes to **Sub-Agent 1**.
*   *User: "My phone is +55..."* -> Root routes to **Sub-Agent 2**.

## 🚀 How to Run

To run this PoC locally using the ADK CLI:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd DataCollectionFromMultipleAgents

# Start the agent in web mode
adk web root_agent.yaml
```

## 🛠 Features
- **Seamless Handoffs**: Automatic transfer between agents based on instruction logic.
- **Markdown Compilation**: Final summary generated by the Root agent.
- **Flexible Dialogue**: Supports natural, non-linear information sharing.
