# Agentic Applications Study & PoC

This repository serves as a collection of experiments and Proof of Concepts (PoCs) developed during my study of agentic applications using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.

## 📖 Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning journey in building complex, multi-agent systems. Through these projects, I aimed to:
*   **Understand Agent Behavior**: Observing how different agents interact and respond to varied user inputs.
*   **Instruction Calibration**: Learning how to fine-tune agent instructions and prompts so they can effectively coordinate work and handle delegation.
*   **Advanced Orchestration**: Exploring concepts like collective memory, intent-based routing, and task-specific specialization.

I hope this resource can be beneficial to others interested in agentic workflows, helping them understand how multiple agents can work together in harmony to complete complex tasks.

## 📁 Projects

### [Data Collection from Multiple Agents](./DataCollectionFromMultipleAgents)
A PoC demonstrating a hierarchical agent structure where a Root agent coordinates data collection by delegating specific tasks to specialized sub-agents.

**Key Features:**
*   **Intent-Based Routing**: Dynamically selecting the right sub-agent based on user input.
*   **Collective Memory**: Sharing information across different agents to provide a seamless user experience.
*   **Collaborative Summarization**: Consolidating data from multiple sources into a unified output.

*For more details, see the [project-specific README](./DataCollectionFromMultipleAgents/README.md).*
